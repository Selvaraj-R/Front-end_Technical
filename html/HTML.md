  ## HTML Anatomy
  * HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content.
    * An opening tag (< p>)
    * The content (“Hello World!” text)
    * A closing tag (</ p>)

 ## HTML Structure
 * HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships.
 * When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.
 * since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as hierarchy.

## Headings
* HTML follows a similar pattern. In HTML, there are six different headings, or heading elements. Headings can be used for a variety of purposes, like titling sections, articles, or other forms of content.
* They are ordered from largest to smallest in size.

    1. < h1> — used for main headings. All other smaller headings are used for subheadings.
    2.  < h2>
    3. < h3>
    4. < h4>
    5. < h5>
    6. < h6>
